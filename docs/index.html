            <h2>Campus Navigation Project</h2>
            <p>The campus navigation app is a powerful tool designed to enhance the user experience for students, faculty, and visitors by offering real-time, location-based guidance across university grounds. Through AI-powered functions and seamless navigation, the app allows users to quickly locate essential facilities such as restrooms, study spaces, and dining halls. Additionally, it provides real-time updates and notifications, including alerts about campus events, building closures, and construction activities. This helps users stay informed and reduces the time spent searching for key locations. Beyond basic navigation, the app also serves as an information hub with an AI assistant that provides responses to user queries, making campus resources more accessible. Users can ask questions such as “Where is the nearest dining hall?” or “What events are happening today?” The AI integration not only promotes convenience and engagement but also fosters productivity by delivering instant access to important information. This intuitive combination of navigation and knowledge-sharing enhances campus life, offering an improved sense of community and efficiency.</p>
